      The Ontario government, generates and maintains thousands of datasets. Since 2012, we have shared data with Ontarians via a data catalogue.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="open-data"></a>
      Open Data
    </h2>
    <p>
      Open data is data that is shared with the public. <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/sharing-government-data">
      Click here to learn more about open data and why Ontario releases it</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontarios-open-data-directive">Ontario’s Open Data Directive</a>
      states that all data must be open, unless there is good reason for it to remain confidential.
    </p>
    <p>Ontario’s Chief Digital and Data Officer also has the authority to make certain datasets available publicly.</p>
    <h2>
      <a name="other-data"></a>
      Other data
    </h2>
    <p>Datasets listed in the catalogue that are not open will have one of the following labels:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Under review</strong> – The dataset is still being screened.
        It may become open or it may be restricted and not released.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Restricted</strong> – The dataset has been screened and will not be released to the public.
        The record will be listed in the catalogue, but the data will not be shared.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      <a name="licensing"></a>
      Data licences and use
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you want to use data you find in the catalogue, that data must have a licence – a set of rules that describes how you can use it. A licence:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>grants you rights to download and use the data</li>
      <li>outlines your rights</li>
      <li>tells you what terms and conditions apply</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Most of the data available in the catalogue is released under
      <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/open-government-licence-ontario">Ontario’s Open Government Licence</a>.
      However, each dataset may be shared with the public under other kinds of licences or no licence at all.
    </p>
    <p>If a dataset doesn’t have a licence, you don’t have the right to use the data.</p>
    <p>
      If you have questions about how you can use a specific dataset, please

    <h3>Data</h3>
    <p>
      The Ontario Data Catalogue endeavors to publish open data in a machine readable format.
      For machine readable datasets, you can simply retrieve the file you need using the file URL.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ontario Data Catalogue is built on CKAN, which means the catalogue has the following features you can
      use when building applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      APIs (Application programming interfaces) let software applications communicate directly with each other.
      If you are using the catalogue in a software application, you might want to extract data from the catalogue through the catalogue API.
    </p>
    <p class="note">Note: All Datastore API requests to the Ontario Data Catalogue must be made server-side.</p>
    <h3>Catalogue API</h3>
    <p>
      The catalogue's collection of dataset metadata (and dataset files) is searchable through the
      <a href="https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/api/">CKAN API</a>.
      The Ontario Data Catalogue has more than just CKAN's documented search fields.
      You can also <a href="#metadata">search these custom fields</a>.
      You can also use the CKAN API to retrieve metadata about a particular dataset and check for updated files.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/api/">Read the complete documentation for CKAN's API.</a>
    </p>
    <h3>Datastore API</h3>
    <p>
      Some of the open data in the Ontario Data Catalogue is available through the Datastore API.
      You can also search and access the machine-readable open data that is available in the catalogue.
    </p>
    <p>How to use the API feature:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Find your dataset.

    <h3>How to use the catalogue</h3>
    <p>
      The Ontario Data Catalogue contains a record for each dataset that the Government of Ontario possesses.
      Some of these datasets will be available to you as open data. Others will not be available to you.
      This is because the Government of Ontario is unable to share data that would break the law or put someone's safety at risk.
    </p>
    <h4>Search</h4>
    <p>
      You can search for a dataset with a word that might describe a dataset or topic. Use words like “taxes” or
      “hospital locations” to discover what datasets the catalogue contains.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can search for a dataset from 3 spots on the catalogue:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <a href="{{ url }}">the homepage</a>,
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="{{ dataset_url }}">the dataset search page</a>, or
        </li>
        <li>the menu bar available across the catalogue.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      On the <a href="{{ dataset_url }}">dataset search page</a>, you can also filter your search results.
      You can select filters on the left hand side of the page to limit your search for datasets with your favourite file format,
      datasets that are updated weekly, datasets released by a particular ministry, or datasets that are released under a specific licence.
      <a href="{{ dataset_url }}">Go to the dataset search page</a> to see the filters that are available to make your search easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also do a quick search by selecting one of the catalogue’s categories on the <a href="{{ url }}">homepage</a>.
      These categories can help you see the types of data we have on key topic areas.
    </p>
    <p>When you find the dataset you are looking for, click on it to go to the dataset record.</p>
    <h4>Dataset record</h4>
    <p>Each dataset record will tell you whether the data is available, and, if so, tell you about the data available.</p>
    <h5>Open Data</h5>
    <p>
      An open dataset might contain several data files. These files might represent different periods of time,
      different sub-sets of the dataset, different regions, language translations, or other breakdowns.
      You can select a file and either download it or preview it.
      Make sure to read the licence agreement to make sure you have permission to use it the way you want.
    </p>

      <a href="{{ help_url }}">Read more about previewing data.</a>
    </p>
    <h5>Non-open data</h5>
    <p>A non-open dataset may be not available for many reasons.</p>

      </a>
    </p>
    <p>Data that is non-open may still be subject to freedom of information requests.</p>
    <h4>Visualizing data</h4>
    <p>
      The catalogue has tools that enable all users to visualize the data in the catalogue without leaving the catalogue – no additional software needed.
      <a href="{{ help_url }}">Have a look at our walk-through of how to make a chart in the catalogue</a>.

    <h3>File Types</h3>
    <p>
      The catalogue provides open data in several file formats (e.g., spreadsheets, geospatial data, etc). Learn about
      each format and how you can access and use the data each file contains.
    </p>
    <div class="format-item">
      <h4>CSV - Comma Separated Values</h4>
      <p>
        A file that has a list of items and values separated by commas without formatting (e.g. colours, italics, etc.)
        or extra visual features. This format provides just the data that you would display in a table. XLSX (Excel)
        files may be converted to CSV so they can be opened in a text editor.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="p-intro"><span class="p-intro">How to access the data:</span></span> Open with any spreadsheet

      <p class="note">
        Note: This format is considered machine-readable, it can be easily processed and used by a computer.
        Files that have visual formatting (e.g. bolded headers and colour-coded rows) can be hard for machines to
        understand, these elements make a file more human-readable and less machine-readable.

    <div class="format-item">
      <h4>Txt – Text file</h4>
      <p>

    <h3>Interpreting data</h3>
    <p>
      Open data on the Ontario Data Catalogue will vary in how it is organized and formatted. Depending on the licence
      agreement for a dataset, you can choose to organize and format the file to suit your intended use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the open data on the Ontario Data Catalogue will have a data dictionary. A data dictionary can help you
      understand what the dataset means.
    </p>
    <p>If you need further understanding the data, reach out to the dataset point of contact.</p>
    <h2>
