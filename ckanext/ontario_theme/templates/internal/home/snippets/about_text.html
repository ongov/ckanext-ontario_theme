    Colby
  </h2>
  <p>
    Colby is the Ontario Public Service's (OPS) internal data catalogue. It is an internal data portal where ministries
    can find and share government data and information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Colby is an inventory of all the data that the OPS possesses. Datasets that don't have any privacy, confidentiality,
    security, legal and contractual obligation, or commercial sensitivity concerns, can be shared with the OPS directly
    (without a need for data sharing agreements or special arrangements) on Colby.
  </p>
  <h2>
    <a name="sharing-data-in-the-ops"></a>
    Sharing data in the OPS
  </h2>
  <p>
    Colby was built to enable data sharing within the OPS. Data sharing is a current government priority because:
    <ul>
      <li>It yields new innovative products and analyses.</li>
      <li>
        It finds efficiencies through reducing requests, data hunting, and duplication of data collection and development.
      </li>
      <li>It aligns the OPS with principles of evidence based decision making and cultural change.</li>
      <li>It enables collaboration by revealing common areas of work across the OPS.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    <a name="sharing-data-on-colby"></a>
    Sharing data on Colby
  </h2>
  <p>
    It's easy to share data on Colby. Follow the process below, which includes all necessary approvals. If you need
    help, please reach out to us at opendata@ontario.ca.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Authority/Approval to share</strong>
      <br />
      Use the exact same approvals process that your ministry uses for posting data and information <strong>to your
      intranet</strong>. <a href="">Contact your open data lead</a> for help.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Appropriateness to share</strong>
      <br />
      Determine whether the dataset is appropriate to share with the OPS. If you're unsure, you'll want to consider the
      following:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Any legal / contractual restrictions to sharing within the OPS
          <br />
          <em>E.g., signed a contract to only share with your branch</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          Any privacy restrictions
          <br />
          <em>
            I.e., dataset contains personal information or other restrictions based on FIPPA
            <br />
            E.g., point of collection established that data would only be shared within ministry
          </em>
        </li>
        <li>
          Any security or confidentiality restrictions
          <br />

  <h2>
    <a name="licensing"></a>
    Data licenses and use
  </h2>
  <p>
    If you want to use data you find in the catalogue, that data must have a licence – a set of rules that describes how
    you can use it. A licence:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      grants you rights to download and use the data
    </li>
    <li>
      outlines your rights
    </li>
    <li>
      tells you what terms and conditions apply
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Most of the data available in the catalogue is released under <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/open-government-licence-ontario">Ontario’s Open Government Licence</a>. However,
    each dataset may be shared under other kinds of licences or no licence at all.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a dataset doesn’t have a licence, you don’t have the right to use the data.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have questions about how you can use a specific dataset, please contact us at <a href="mailto:opendata@ontario.ca">opendata@ontario.ca</a>.

  <h3>
    Data
  </h3>
  <p>
    Colby endeavors to publish open data in a machine readable format. For machine readable datasets, you can simply
    retrieve the file you need using the file URL.
  </p>
  <p>
    Colby is built on CKAN, which means the catalogue has the following features you can use when building applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    APIs (Application programming interfaces) let software applications communicate directly with each other. If you are
    using the catalogue in a software application, you might want to extract data from the catalogue through the
    catalogue API.
  </p>
  <p class="note">
    Note: All Datastore API requests to the Colby must be made server-side.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Catalogue API
  </h3>
  <p>
    The catalogue's collection of dataset metadata (and dataset files) is searchable through the <a href="https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/api/">CKAN API</a>.
    Colby has more than just CKAN's documented search fields. You can also <a href="#metadata">search these custom
    fields</a>. You can also use the CKAN API to retrieve metadata about a particular dataset and check for updated
    files.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/api/">Read the complete documentation for CKAN's API.</a>
  </p>
  <h3>
    Datastore API
  </h3>
  <p>
    Some of the open data in Colby is available through the Datastore API. You can also search and access the
    machine-readable open data that is available in the catalogue.
  </p>
  <p>
    How to use the API feature:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Find your dataset.

    How to use the catalogue
  </h3>
  <p>
    Colby contains a record for each dataset that the Government of Ontario possesses. Some of these datasets will be
    available to you. Others will not be available to you. This is because the Government of Ontario is unable to share
    data that would break the law or put someone's safety at risk. For these datasets, you might consider reaching out
    to the dataset owner to discuss potential partnerships and opportunities.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Search
  </h4>
  <p>
    You can search for a dataset with a word that might describe a dataset or topic. Use words like “taxes” or “hospital
    locations” to discover what datasets the catalogue contains.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can search for a dataset from 3 spots on the catalogue:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <a href="/">the homepage</a>,
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/dataset">the dataset search page</a>, or
      </li>
      <li>
        the menu bar available across the catalogue.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    On the <a href="/dataset">dataset search page</a>, you can also filter your search results. You can select filters
    on the left hand side of the page to limit your search for datasets with your favourite file format, datasets that
    are updated weekly, datasets released by a particular ministry, or datasets that are released under a specific
    licence. <a href="/dataset">Go to the dataset search page</a> to see the filters that are available to make your
    search easier.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also do a quick search by selecting one of the catalogue’s categories on the <a href="/">homepage</a>. These
    categories can help you see the types of data we have on key topic areas.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you find the dataset you are looking for, click on it to go to the dataset record.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Dataset record
  </h4>
  <p>
    Each dataset record will tell you whether the data is available, and, if so, tell you about the data available.
  </p>
  <h5>
    Data Available
  </h5>
  <p>
    A dataset with data available might contain several data files. These files might represent different periods of
    time, different sub-sets of the dataset, different regions, language translations, or other breakdowns. You can
    select a file and either download it or preview it. Make sure to read the licence agreement to make sure you have
    permission to use it the way you want.
  </p>
  <h5>
    Data not available
  </h5>
  <p>
    A dataset with no data may be not available for many reasons. If the dataset has any of the following concerns, it
    cannot be shared:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      privacy
    </li>
    <li>
      confidentiality
    </li>
    <li>
      security
    </li>
    <li>
      legal and contractual obligation
    </li>
    <li>
      commercial sensitivity
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>
    Visualizing data
  </h4>
  <p>
    The catalogue has tools that enable all users to visualize the data in the catalogue without leaving the catalogue –
    no additional software needed. You can visualize data through the "Preview" feature.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>Preview</strong> option lets you see a dataset without downloading it. You will see this option for
    files that are stored as common file types, like CSVs.
