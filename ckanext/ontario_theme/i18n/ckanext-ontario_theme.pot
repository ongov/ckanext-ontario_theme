"<h3>How to use the catalogue</h3> <p> The Ontario Data Catalogue contains a "
"record for each dataset that the Government of Ontario possesses. Some of "
"these datasets will be available to you as open data. Others will not be "
"available to you. This is because the Government of Ontario is unable to "
"share data that would break the law or put someone's safety at risk. </p> "
"<h4>Search</h4> <p> You can search for a dataset with a word that might "
"describe a dataset or topic. Use words like “taxes” or “hospital locations” "
"to discover what datasets the catalogue contains. </p> <p> You can search for"
" a dataset from 3 spots on the catalogue: <ol> <li> <a href=\"%(url)s\">the "
"homepage</a>, </li> <li> <a href=\"%(dataset_url)s\">the dataset search "
"page</a>, or </li> <li>the menu bar available across the catalogue.</li> "
"</ol> </p> <p> On the <a href=\"%(dataset_url)s\">dataset search page</a>, "
"you can also filter your search results. You can select filters on the left "
"hand side of the page to limit your search for datasets with your favourite "
"file format, datasets that are updated weekly, datasets released by a "
"particular ministry, or datasets that are released under a specific licence. "
"<a href=\"%(dataset_url)s\">Go to the dataset search page</a> to see the "
"filters that are available to make your search easier. </p> <p> You can also "
"do a quick search by selecting one of the catalogue’s categories on the <a "
"href=\"%(url)s\">homepage</a>. These categories can help you see the types of"
" data we have on key topic areas. </p> <p>When you find the dataset you are "
"looking for, click on it to go to the dataset record.</p> <h4>Dataset "
"record</h4> <p>Each dataset record will tell you whether the data is "
"available, and, if so, tell you about the data available.</p> <h5>Open "
"Data</h5> <p> An open dataset might contain several data files. These files "

"provides open data in several file formats (e.g., spreadsheets, geospatial "
"data, etc). Learn about each format and how you can access and use the data "
"each file contains. </p> <div class=\"format-item\"> <h4>CSV - Comma "
"Separated Values</h4> <p> A file that has a list of items and values "
"separated by commas without formatting (e.g. colours, italics, etc.) or extra"
" visual features. This format provides just the data that you would display "
"in a table. XLSX (Excel) files may be converted to CSV so they can be opened "
"in a text editor. </p> <p> <span class=\"p-intro\"><span "
"class=\"p-intro\">How to access the data:</span></span> Open with any "
"spreadsheet software application (e.g., Open Office Calc, Microsoft Excel) or"
" text editor. </p> <p class=\"note\"> Note: This format is considered "
"machine-readable, it can be easily processed and used by a computer. Files "
"that have visual formatting (e.g. bolded headers and colour-coded rows) can "
"be hard for machines to understand, these elements make a file more human-"
"readable and less machine-readable. </p> </div> <div class=\"format-item\"> "
"<h4>Txt – Text file</h4> <p> A file that provides information without "
"formatted text or extra visual features that may not follow a pattern of "
"separated values like a CSV. </p> <p> <span class=\"p-intro\">How to access "
"the data:</span> Open with any word processor or text editor available on "
"your device (e.g., Microsoft Word, Notepad). </p> </div> <div class=\"format-"

"provides geographic information that can be used to create a map or perform "
"geospatial analysis based on location, points/lines and other data about the "
