"it</a>. </p> <p> <a href=\"%(directive_url)s\">Ontario’s Digital and Data "
"Directive</a> states that all data must be open, unless there is good reason "
"for it to remain confidential. </p> <p>Ontario’s Chief Digital and Data "
"Officer also has the authority to make certain datasets available "
"publicly.</p> <h2 id=\"other-data\">Other data</h2> <p>Datasets listed in the"
" catalogue that are not open will have one of the following labels:</p> <ul> "
"<li> <strong>Under review</strong> – The dataset is still being screened. It "
"may become open or it may be restricted and not released. </li> <li> "
"<strong>Restricted</strong> – The dataset has been screened and will not be "

"data will not be shared. </li> </ul> <h2 id=\"licensing\">Data licences and "
"use</h2> <p> If you want to use data you find in the catalogue, that data "
"must have a licence – a set of rules that describes how you can use it. A "
"licence: </p> <ul> <li>grants you rights to download and use the data</li> "
"<li>outlines your rights</li> <li>tells you what terms and conditions "

"id=\"developers\">Developers resources</h2> <h3>Data</h3> <p> The Ontario "
"Data Catalogue endeavors to publish open data in a machine readable format. "
"For machine readable datasets, you can simply retrieve the file you need "
"using the file URL. </p> <p> The Ontario Data Catalogue is built on CKAN, "
"which means the catalogue has the following features you can use when "
"building applications. </p> <p> APIs (Application programming interfaces) let"
" software applications communicate directly with each other. If you are using"
" the catalogue in a software application, you might want to extract data from"
" the catalogue through the catalogue API. </p> <p class=\"note\">Note: All "
"Datastore API requests to the Ontario Data Catalogue must be made server-"
"side.</p> <h3>Catalogue API</h3> <p> The catalogue's collection of dataset "
"metadata (and dataset files) is searchable through the <a "
"href=\"https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/api/\">CKAN API</a>. The Ontario Data "
"Catalogue has more than just CKAN's documented search fields. You can also <a"
" href=\"#metadata\">search these custom fields</a>. You can also use the CKAN"
" API to retrieve metadata about a particular dataset and check for updated "
"files. </p> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/api/\">Read the "
"complete documentation for CKAN's API.</a> </p> <h3>Datastore API</h3> <p> "
"Some of the open data in the Ontario Data Catalogue is available through the "
"Datastore API. You can also search and access the machine-readable open data "
"that is available in the catalogue. </p> <p>How to use the API feature:</p> "

"the catalogue</h3> <p> The Ontario Data Catalogue contains a record for each "
"dataset that the Government of Ontario possesses. Some of these datasets will"
" be available to you as open data. Others will not be available to you. This "
"is because the Government of Ontario is unable to share data that would break"
" the law or put someone's safety at risk. </p> <h4>Search</h4> <p> You can "
"search for a dataset with a word that might describe a dataset or topic. Use "
"words like “taxes” or “hospital locations” to discover what datasets the "
"catalogue contains. </p> <p> You can search for a dataset from 3 spots on the"
" catalogue: <ol> <li> <a href=\"%(url)s\">the homepage</a>, </li> <li> <a "
"href=\"%(dataset_url)s\">the dataset search page</a>, or </li> <li>the menu "
"bar available across the catalogue.</li> </ol> </p> <p> On the <a "
"href=\"%(dataset_url)s\">dataset search page</a>, you can also filter your "
"search results. You can select filters on the left hand side of the page to "
"limit your search for datasets with your favourite file format, datasets that"
" are updated weekly, datasets released by a particular ministry, or datasets "
"that are released under a specific licence. <a href=\"%(dataset_url)s\">Go to"
" the dataset search page</a> to see the filters that are available to make "
"your search easier. </p> <p> You can also do a quick search by selecting one "
"of the catalogue’s categories on the <a href=\"%(url)s\">homepage</a>. These "
"categories can help you see the types of data we have on key topic areas. "
"</p> <p>When you find the dataset you are looking for, click on it to go to "
"the dataset record.</p> <h4>Dataset record</h4> <p>Each dataset record will "
"tell you whether the data is available, and, if so, tell you about the data "
"available.</p> <h5>Open Data</h5> <p> An open dataset might contain several "
"data files. These files might represent different periods of time, different "
"sub-sets of the dataset, different regions, language translations, or other "
"breakdowns. You can select a file and either download it or preview it. Make "
"sure to read the licence agreement to make sure you have permission to use it"
" the way you want. </p> <h5>Non-open data</h5> <p>A non-open dataset may be "
"not available for many reasons.</p> <p> <a href=\"#other-data\">Read more "
"about non-open data.</a> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://www.ontario.ca/document"

"to visualize the data in the catalogue without leaving the catalogue – no "
"additional software needed. </p> <h4> <a name=\"features-notifications\"></a>"
