Directory Structure
-------------------

Four directories compose this repository

-  **scripts:** contains scripts to setup CKAN and required applications
-  **config:** contains configuration files needed for installation and
   configuration of CKAN
-  **ckanext:** Ontario Theme Extension files for CKAN
-  **bin:** contains CI scripts that are no longer being used. This
   directory is pending deletion/cleanup

Plugins in this Extension:
--------------------------

-  ``ontario_theme`` base and internal-facing Ontario data catalogue
-  ``ontario_theme_external`` customizations for external facing Ontario
   data catalogue (requires ``ontario_theme``)

Installation
------------

To install ckanext-ontario_theme for development, activate your CKAN
virtualenv and do:

::

   git clone https://github.com/ongov/ckanext-ontario_theme.git
   cd ckanext-ontario_theme
   python setup.py develop
   pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

   python setup.py develop
   pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

Update the development.ini (or production.ini) plugins:

::

   # This relies on scheming and fluent, make sure these are already installed.
   # Note: This extension needs to be before scheming and fluent in the *.ini 
   # config file to let the form overrides work.

   # For external catalogue
   ckan.plugins = [...] ontario_theme_external ontario_theme scheming_datasets scheming_organizations scheming_groups fluent [...]

   # Add licenses
   licenses_group_url = file:///<path to this extension>/ckanext/ontario_theme/schemas/licences.json

Setup for CKAN tracking
(https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/maintaining/tracking.html). The config
setting is in the ``plugin.py`` already.

Create a sysadmin user, login and set the HomePage layout under Admin ->
Config to the third option. Our homepage uses this layout as its base.


ckanext-validation Integration
------------------------------

This code contains a redesign of the workflow for adding and editing
resources where users are guided by a four-step wizard process. *Note:
this is still a work-in-progress.*

Step 1:
~~~~~~~

CSV files selected for upload are checked for header and table property
errors by the ckanext-validation extension. Only files that pass all
checks are pushed to datastore. |Screenshot-step1|

--------------

Step 2:
~~~~~~~

Intermediate step: the user is notified that the validation was
successful while XLoader asynchronously pushes the CSV file to the
database. A load indicator is displayed during the submission process,
which could take seconds to minutes, depending on the file size:

When the XLoader job status is complete, a “Continue” button is
displayed that redirects to the Data Dictionary page (Step 3):
|Screenshot step2_continue|

--------------

Step 3:
~~~~~~~

Data Dictionary: the default CKAN data dictionary form is displayed to
allow data type definitions. The validation plugin checks against the
data types saved in the form.

   :alt: Screenshot step3


--------------

Step 4:
~~~~~~~

Successful data type validation leads to the final page in the workflow
where the user can review the metadata and data dictionary info and
either link back to make changes or publish as is.

Development
-----------

Follow the `CKAN style
rules <http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/contributing/css.html#formatting>`__.

Installing dev-tools and pre-commit hooks for development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Activate your CKAN virtualenv and run:

::

   pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
   pre-commit install

We use the djLint pre-commit hook to lint our code.

Adding ODC recommended settings to your vscode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For our CSS formatting, we are using the vscode CSS formatter.

1. Create file ``settings.json`` in the ``.vscode`` folder
2. Copy contents of ``settings.json.default`` into the ``settings.json``
   file. Save.

Translations
------------

Current Process:

-  We currently do them manually
-  We have not been updating the line numbers or comments at all
-  We edit the .pot and .po files manually for new and modified strings
-  the .mo file is generated at deployment on the server with
   ``python setup.py compile_catalog`` from the
   ``ckanext-ontario_theme`` directory

Initial Creation:

-  Initially the .pot file was created as per docs
   (``python setup.py extract_messages``) and we generated the .po file
   for our locale as well (``python setup.py init_catalog -l fr``). Some
   tweaks were made for formatting large strings and removing things
   that are covered by the CKAN .po files (e.g. “Dataset” is already
   translated).

Additional Info:

-  you have a template file (.pot) that has the ``msgid`` and the empty
   ``msgstr``.
-  the template can be used to create other locale translation files
   (e.g. French, Spanish, German, etc.)
-  the translation files (.po) have the “id” and the translation for
   that locale. The translation text is manually added in (or with
   something like Transifex).
-  the .mo file is the compiled translation for each locale that is used
   when displaying the site in that locale.
-  Note: if you regenerate the .pot file it replaces the existing one
   based on the current state of the templates. If you then regenerate
   the .po file it does the same and all translation content will be
   lost unless you do an update and go through for edits. It’s partially
   why this form of translations are for things that are static content
   that change rarely. More dynamic content should be handled elsewhere
   (e.g. see ckanext-fluent)

Running the Tests
-----------------

To run the tests, make sure your ckan install is `setup for
tests <https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/contributing/test.html>`__, do:

::

   cd ckanext-ontario_theme # go to extension directory
   pytest --ckan-ini=test.ini ckanext/ontario_theme/tests/

To run the tests and produce a coverage report, first make sure you have
coverage installed in your virtualenv (``pip install coverage``) then
run:

::

   coverage run -m pytest --ckan-ini=test.ini ckanext/ontario_theme/tests/

You can then run:

::

   coverage html

or:

::

   coverage report

You can then find the coverage reports in a generated htmlcov folder.

Our custom config settings are in ``./test.ini``.

Running a single test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Single Test class*:

::

   coverage run -m pytest --ckan-ini=test.ini ckanext/ontario_theme/tests/test_create_dataset.py::test_package_create_with_invalid_update_frequency 

*Single Test module*:

::

   coverage run -m pytest --ckan-ini=test.ini ckanext/ontario_theme/tests/test_create_dataset.py
